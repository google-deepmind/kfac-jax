KFAC-JAX Documentation
======================

KFAC-JAX is a library built on top of `JAX <https://github.com/jax-ml/jax>`_ for
second-order optimization of neural networks and for computing scalable
curvature approximations.
The main goal of the library is to provide researchers with an easy-to-use
implementation of the `K-FAC paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05671>`_
optimizer and curvature estimator.


Installation
------------

KFAC-JAX is written in pure Python, but depends on C++ code via JAX.

First, follow `these instructions <https://github.com/jax-ml/jax#installation>`_
to install JAX with the relevant accelerator support.

Then, install KFAC-JAX using pip::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/google-deepmind/kfac-jax

Alternatively, you can install via PyPI::

    $ pip install -U kfac-jax

Our examples rely on additional libraries, all of which you can install using::

    $ pip install -r requirements_examples.txt
